# touchless-travel
Stuttgart Hackathon 2015 Project - Team Hackerstolz and Friends

### Idea
Create a real pay-as-you go solution: No more tickets, no more terminals, no more queues.
Touchless Travei is the worlds first approach that leverages iBeacon technology to track public transport rides. Your phone recognizes the vehicle when you enter and leave, thus being able to infere the distance traveled.
At the end of the month users receive a summed bill that is automatically optimized based on the 
public transport usage. I.e. the actually used tickets are selected afterwards.
